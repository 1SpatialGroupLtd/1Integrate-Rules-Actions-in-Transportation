# Sample Road Checks
This repo folder contains some Sample Road checks by Rule that can be used within 1Integrate.  
These road checks are used by a number of State DOT's using 1Spatial's 1Integrate software.

## [Roads Must Not Overlap Other Roads](RoadsDoNotOverlapOtherRoads.xml)
Overlaps occur when linear start/end points go past one another so a portion of Line A is on top of/underneath a portion of Line B.  This rule checks for those instances while also checking that roads do not self-overlap.
### Rule Syntax
Check for Road objects that there are no Road objects other for which Road:other.geometry overlaps Road.geometry and Road:other does not equal Road

## [Road Network Must Not Contain Bifurcations](RoadNetworkMustNotContainBifurcations.xml)
Bifurcations are situations where a branch splits into 2 and the splits retain some of the branches attributes.  Check that there is at most only a single segment with the same STREET value intersecting the end points of road segments.
### Rule Syntax
Check for Road objects that there is at most 1 Road objects other for which Road:other.geometry intersects start_of(Road.geometry), Road:other.STREET equals Roads.STREET, and Road:other does not equal Road; AND there is at most 1 Road objects other for which Road:other.geometry intersects end_of(Road.geometry), Road:other.STREET equals Road.STREET, and Road:other does not equal Road.
