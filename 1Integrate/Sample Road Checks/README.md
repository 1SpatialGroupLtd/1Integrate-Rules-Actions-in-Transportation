# Sample Road Checks
This repo folder contains some Sample Road checks by Rule that can be used within 1Integrate.  
These road checks are used by a number of State DOT's using 1Spatial's 1Integrate software.

## [Road Geometry Must Not Be Too Short or NULL](RoadGeometryMustNotBeTooShortOrNull.xml)
Tests to see if a Road geometry is too short or NULL. For this example, a Road geometry needs to be longer than the data unit of length of 3. This rule uses the built-in function line_length. The line_length built-in function returns the length of a line. If the geometry passed in is a simple point or a simple area, then the length returned will be 0. If it is a complex geometry, the length returned will be the sum of the lengths of each simple line in the complex geometry. Note: This function does not currently fully support 3D geometries. Any 3D geometries will be projected down to 2 dimensions.
### Rule Syntax
Checks for Road objects that have NULL geometry and a line_length with data unit length of 3.

## [Road Network Must Not Contain Bifurcations](RoadNetworkMustNotContainBifurcations.xml)
Bifurcations are situations where a branch splits into 2 and the splits retain some of the branches attributes.  Check that there is at most only a single segment with the same STREET value intersecting the end points of road segments.
### Rule Syntax
Check for Road objects that there is at most 1 Road objects other for which Road:other.geometry intersects start_of(Road.geometry), Road:other.STREET equals Roads.STREET, and Road:other does not equal Road; AND there is at most 1 Road objects other for which Road:other.geometry intersects end_of(Road.geometry), Road:other.STREET equals Road.STREET, and Road:other does not equal Road.

## [Roads Must Intersect at Start and End Points](RoadsMustIntersectAtStartAndEndPoints.xml)
Tests to see that Roads intersects other Roads at the start and end only, as opposed to anywhere along its geometry. This rule explicitly checks the four scenarios in which Roads may intersect each other: start to start, start to end, end to start, and end to end.
### Rule Syntax
Check for Roads objects that for all Road objects other for which Road:other.geometry intersects Road.geometry check that the start_of or end_of Road:other.geometry intersects the start_of or end_of Road.geometry.

## [Roads Must Not Contain Other Roads](RoadsDoNotContainOtherRoads.xml)
Linear containment occurs when a Road geometry completely contains another Road geometry.
### Rule Syntax
Check for Road objects that there are no Road objects other for which Road:other.geometry contains Road.geometry and Road:other does not equal Road

## [Roads Must Not Overlap Other Roads](RoadsDoNotOverlapOtherRoads.xml)
Overlaps occur when linear start/end points go past one another so a portion of Line A is on top of/underneath a portion of Line B.  This rule checks for those instances while also checking that roads do not self-overlap.
### Rule Syntax
Check for Road objects that there are no Road objects other for which Road:other.geometry overlaps Road.geometry and Road:other does not equal Road
