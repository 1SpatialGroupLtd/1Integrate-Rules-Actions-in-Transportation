## README
This repository contains files for HPMS to be used in 1Integrate, it is broken up into three folders: Data, Docs, and Rules. The Data folder contains the sample data, Docs contains the QuickStartGuide to help you get started, and Rules contains the xml file to be uploaded into 1Integrate. The xml file, which is to be uploaded into 1Integrate will produce two sessions. One session, the Rules, will perform HPMS checks on Domain, Coverage, and Cross. The other will perform HPMS checks and actions (via Action Maps) to create a spatial report layer of nonconformances.
