## [Check for Duplicate Features](CheckForDuplicateFeatures.xml)
Checks for two features within the same class (aka Feature Class) that has the same geometry 
### Rule Syntax
Check for objects all that there are no objects duplicate features for which :duplicate features.geometry equals :all.geometry and class(:duplicate features) equals class(:all) and :duplicate features does not equal :all

## [Check for Duplicate Vertices](CheckForDuplicateVertices.xml)
Checks for Duplicate Vertices.  The Duplicate Vertex checks a geometry (Line or Polygon) that has any consecutive coincident vertices.  This rule uses the Built-In function has_duplicates() that Tests to see if a geometry has any consecutive coincident vertices.  It returns a Boolean value, true if the geometry has any consecutive coincident vertices and false if it does not. 
### Rule Syntax
Check for objects all that has_duplicates(:all.geometry) equals false  
![Alt text](img/DuplicateVerticesRule.png?raw=true "Duplicate Vertex Rule Screenshot")

## [Check for Kickbacks](CheckForKickbacks.xml)
Checks whether a geometry has any kickbacks, aka snap-backs, cutbacks, (a type of geometric error where a line segment changes direction twice by approximately 180 degrees to repeat part of the line).  This rule uses the has_kickbacks built-in function.  The has_kickbacks function Checks whether a geometry has any kickbacks (a type of geometric error where a line segment changes direction twice by approximately 180 degrees to repeat part of the line).  The parameters can be configured.  The inputs are 1) geometry to test. 2) (optional) The maximum value for the sine of the angles in the kickback. Note: If omitted, this defaults to the sine of 1 degree. 3) (optional) The maximum width of the kickback. 
This rule uses a 12 degree tolerance.

### Rule Syntax
Check for objects all that has_kickbacks(:all.geometry,sin(to_radians(12))) equals false  
![Alt text](img/KickbackRule.png?raw=true "Kickback Rule Screenshot")

## [Check for Multipart Geometries](CheckForMultipartGeometries.xml)
Checks for Multi-Part Geometries.  A multi-part geometry are geometries that contain more than one part.  For example, the State of Hawaii, if modeled as one feature in a table, would be a multi-part polygon because it contains multiple polygon geometries for each island within that record.  This rule uses the Count-Parts to determine if there is only 1 part for the geometry.  If the feature has no geometry or has more than 1 part, it will be flagged as a non-conformance.

### Rule Syntax
Check for objects all that count_parts(:all.geometry) equals 1

## [Check for OGC Simple](CheckThatFeaturesAreSimple.xml)
Tests to see if a feature is simple based on the [OGC definition](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sfa).
According to the OGC Specifications, a simple geometry is one that has no anomalous geometric points, such as self intersection or self tangency and primarily refers to 0 or 1-dimensional geometries (i.e. [MULTI]POINT, [MULTI]LINESTRING). Geometry validity, on the other hand, primarily refers to 2-dimensional geometries (i.e. [MULTI]POLYGON) and defines the set of assertions that characterizes a valid polygon. The description of each geometric class includes specific conditions that further detail geometric simplicity and validity.
A POINT is inheritably simple as a 0-dimensional geometry object.
MULTIPOINTs are simple if no two coordinates (POINTs) are equal (have identical coordinate values).
A LINESTRING is simple if it does not pass through the same POINT twice (except for the endpoints, in which case it is referred to as a linear ring and additionally considered closed). 
The information on OGC Simple was pulled from the PostGIS Documentation on [OGC Simplicity](https://postgis.net/docs/using_postgis_dbmanagement.html#OGC_Validity).  

### Rule Syntax
Check for all objects ALL that: is_simple(ALL.geometry) equals true

## [Check for OGC Valid](CheckThatFeaturesAreValid.xml)
Tests to see if a feature is valid based on the [OGC definition](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sfa).
By definition, a POLYGON is always simple. It is valid if no two rings in the boundary (made up of an exterior ring and interior rings) cross. The boundary of a POLYGON may intersect at a POINT but only as a tangent (i.e. not on a line). A POLYGON may not have cut lines or spikes and the interior rings must be contained entirely within the exterior ring.
A MULTIPOLYGON is valid if and only if all of its elements are valid and the interiors of no two elements intersect. The boundaries of any two elements may touch, but only at a finite number of POINTs.
The information on OGC Valid was pulled from the PostGIS Documentation on [OGC Validity](https://postgis.net/docs/using_postgis_dbmanagement.html#OGC_Validity).  

### Rule Syntax
Check for all objects ALL that: is_valid(ALL.geometry) equals true  
![Alt text](img/OGCValidRule.PNG?raw=true "OGC Valid Rule Screenshot")

## [Check for Spikes](CheckForSpikes.xml)
Checks whether a geometry has any spikes.  A spike is defined to be three consecutive points (A, B, C) such that: 1) The distance AB is less than the distance BC. 2) The sine of the angle ABC is less than a maximum value which may be specified by the second parameter. 3) (Optionally) the distance AB is less than a maximum "length" value specified by the third parameter.  This rule uses the has_spikes() built-in function which has the following parameters.  1) The geometry to test. 2) (optional) The maximum value for the sine of the angle in the spike (a real number in the range [0, 1]). Note: If omitted, this defaults to the sine of 1 degree (approximately 0.017). 3) (optional) The maximum length of the spike.
This rule uses a 6 degree tolerance.

### Rule Syntax
Check for objects all that has_spikes(:all.geometry,sin(to_radians(6))) equals false

## [Check that Features are Topologically Structured](CheckThatFeaturesAreTopologicallyStructured.xml)
Tests whether an object is topologically structured. It returns a boolean value, true if the object is structured and false otherwise.

### Rule Syntax
Check for objects all that is_structured(:all.geometry) equals true
